# Packetris
A tetris like game, simulating the situation of a packet delivery man loading his vehicle. 
Packets must be arranged as they are pushed into the vehicle to fit as much packets as possible. The more packets you fit into the available space, the higher your score becomes.

# About the game
The game contains two modes:
- Standard: In this mode all packages fall down with moderate speed, but may have a complex, concave shape.
- Speed: In this mode the fall down speed of the packages is doubled, but you only have to deal with simplified, convex shapes.

You will notice that the game seems really easy at the beginning, but the more packets have been placed, the shorter is the time for you to arrange new packets. Especially in the speed mode, you will see that this almost becomes impossible in the second half of a round.

##Controls
To control the game, just use the movement and rotation controls on the bottom edge of the game screen. With them, you can easily rotate and move the currently falling down package.

## Installation
Just use the the <code>Packetris.apk</code> provided in the latest release in <code>release/</code> and install it on your Android Phone.
You need at least Android 7.0 (Sdk Version 24) to run the game. For older versions of Android, you may be able to compile it for this version yourself.
